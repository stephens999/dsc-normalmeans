This repo does simulations to compare methods for the "normalmeans" problem.
It compares `ashr` with `EbayesThresh` and the horseshoe prior. 
It uses the [dscr](http://github.com/stephens999/dscr) framework to do the simulations.
It is very much work in progress.
Possibly we will switch these comparisons to the DSC2 framework in the future.
